# TypeScript session two exercises

## Material for the session

[wunderdog.dev/presentations/advanced](https://wunderdog.dev/presentations/advanced)

## Working with the exercises

The exercises are supplied as function stubs in `src/session_two.ts` which you are expected to fill in.

The function stubs are accompanied by tests in `test/session_two.tests.ts`. When a test set for a given function passes, an exercise has been completed.

### Running the tests

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```

### Lint your code

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Working with the exercises

Open the `src/session_two.ts` in an editor with TypeScript support (a recent version of VS Code is highly recommended), fill in the behavior to the function stubs and run the test set.

Note that Jest (the test runner) will not report type errors!

Focus on specific excercises by running the `watch`-command, press p, and write a filter, like `get`.

As long as there are failing tests, just keep repeating the process. Enjoy!
